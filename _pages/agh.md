### The AGH University of Krakow (AGH University) is a modern university that actively participates in fostering a knowledge-based society and creating innovative technologies. University has a well-established position in the country and is recognised abroad. Experienced staff, advanced laboratories, a unique campus, and, above all, the bonds that connect the AGH University community are the greatest assets.

# History of AGH University
The efforts to establish a Polish mining school in Krakow and to appoint suitable teaching staff began in the second half of the 19th century and intensified when Galicia gained autonomy in 1860. Numerous projects were developed that considered, among other things, the creation of an independent mining academy or a faculty of mining at the Lviv Polytechnic or the Technical Institute in Krakow.

 At the beginning of the 20th century, a group of prominent engineers and mining activists, led by Jan Zara≈Ñski, went to great lengths to obtain approval for establishing a higher education institution in Krakow to educate mining engineers. Concentrated diplomatic action was taken in Vienna to win the favour of the Austrian government.

These efforts were successful, and on July 10, 1912, Krakow authorities received
a permit to establish a mining academy.
